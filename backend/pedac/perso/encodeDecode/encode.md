# String Encode and Decode

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decoded`

## Understand the Problem

### Input

- `encode`: An array of strings
- `decoded`: A string

### Output

- `encode`: A string
- `decoded`: An array of strings

### Questions

- Is the array of strings composed of single (1 word) or multiple blocks of strings?

### Mental Model

## Example / Test Cases

- `encode`:
- `decoded`:

Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

Output:["neet","code","love","you"]

## Data Structures

- `encode`:
- `decoded`:

## Algorithm
